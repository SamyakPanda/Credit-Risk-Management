# Credit-Risk-Management
This project is focused on creating a comprehensive machine learning model to predict the likelihood of loan repayment by applicants. Using data from Home Credit, we will preprocess, engineer features, and train multiple models to evaluate credit risk, with a strong emphasis on managing imbalanced data and enhancing model performance.
